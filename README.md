##visualizing audio in D3 + transforming raw audio signals

The purpose of this project was to play around with JavaScript Web Audio API and find appropriate transformations for raw frequencies that are compatible with speech processing tasks. You'll find the raw visualizations below. To see one of the transformations implemented (Mel frequency cepstral coefficients) click [here](https://github.com/dorajam/Voice-detection/tree/master/soundTransformation).
